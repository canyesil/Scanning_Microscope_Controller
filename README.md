# Scanning Microscope Controller 

Basic scanning stage controller which consists of two parts, i.e.,

i)  usb-serial device including micro stage and laser driver circuits (Arduino Uno used in the prototype) 

ii) Platform independent controller interface based on Wolfram, Mathematica

The whole project is still under development.

So far, scanning laser microscopy as well as magneto-optical scanning Kerr microscopy have been successfully realized.

Video demonstrations will be uploaded to YouTube soon. 

***

Prerequisites: Wolfram Engine (Free for developers) or Mathematica must be installed.

Usage: Run Create_Controller_Palette.nb, that will create Mathematica Palette app like shown below.

To do: Control circuit diagram will be uploaded.
